  /* This file contains configuration for the menus in the layout. 
   * It allows you to make most changes to menus without recompiling the source code, 
   * thereby letting designers quickly build their theme
   * It has three sections:
   * - Version is simply a version number, to better control when the code expects a different structure
   * - Menus which uses a string-key to identify a configuration, and determins which pages should be shown
   * - Designs uses a string key as well, and determines look and feel through CSS-Classes added to the HTML
   *
   * Note: This is a JSON file but the parser will treat it as JSONC, so you can add comments
