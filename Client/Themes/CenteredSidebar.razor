File Purpose:       Theme which shows the content *centered* on the page with a *sidebar*
Recommendations:    -
Nice to know:
    - Inherits from the Default.razor, so all code is there
    - The few variables below adjust how the Default.razor will create the output
      ...but most of it is just some body classes + show/hide certain menus
    - It needs the BuildRenderTree to basically just run the base class

@code
{
    public override string Name => "Centered with Sidebar";
    public override string Layout => "sidebar"; // special
    protected override string MagicClasses => "centered";
}
@{
    // Razor internal method to build with the HTML of the base Default.razor
    base.BuildRenderTree(__builder);
}
