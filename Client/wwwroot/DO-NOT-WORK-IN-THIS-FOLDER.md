# IMPORTANT: Don't work in the wwwroot folder

Do NOT edit any files in this folder or subfolders!

All the files and folders in the wwwroot are generated from other files which are located in the `/src` folder.

Because of this, everything you do here will be flushed and replaced with newly generated files on every build.

So don't try to edit stuff here.
