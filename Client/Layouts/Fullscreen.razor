    File Purpose:       Theme which shows the content with *fullscreen width*
    Recommendations:    -
    Nice to know:       Inherits from the Default.razor, so all code is there
                        The few variables below adjust how the Default.razor will create the output
                        ...but most of it is just some body classes + show/hide certain menus
                        It needs the BuildRenderTree to basically just run the base class
