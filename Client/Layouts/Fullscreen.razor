    File Purpose:       Theme which shows the content with *fullscreen width*
    Recommendations:    -
    Nice to know:       Inherits from the Default.razor, so all code is there
                        The few variables below adjust how the Default.razor will create the output
                        ...but most of it is just some body classes + show/hide certain menus
                        It needs the BuildRenderTree to basically just run the base class

@{ 
    base.BuildRenderTree(__builder);

@code{
    // Name to show in the Theme-picker
    public override string Name => "Fullscreen";

    // ClassName is used to set the body class which sets the css for this specific layout
    protected override string ClassName => "fullscreen";

    // Determines if we should show a Nav on the side of the layout in addition to top
    protected override bool ShowSidebarNavigation => false;

    // Show a breadcrumb on top?
    protected override bool ShowBreadcrumb => true;
