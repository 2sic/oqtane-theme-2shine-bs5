# Build and Deploy 2shine for Oqtane

TODO: intro, explanation

There are some different node commands which help you to build and deploy the theme to oqtane:

      1. build          -> This will build the theme and deploy it to the designated location (in the `build-theme.json` file)
      3. dotnet-watch   -> This will watch all of the .razor files and build and deploy the theme everytime it detects changes
      2. webpack-watch  -> This will run webpack and watch the .scss and .ts files for changes and build and deliver them
